# Isabelle Hacks

This project contains small Isabelle "hacks" that provide additional 
functionality to [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) or showcase
specific functionality. The individual hacks usually consist out of 
a single theory file and all documentation is contained in that 
theory file. The master branch should work with the latest official 
release of Isabelle (Isabelle 2022, at time of writing), hacks for 
older versions might be available on a dedicated branch.

## List of Isabelle Hacks

* [Assert.thy](Assert.thy) provides a new top level command **assert**
  that provides a simple way for specifying assertions that Isabelle
  checks while processing a theory.

* [Code_Reflection.thy](Code_Reflection.thy) provides a new top-level 
  command for reflecting generated SML code into Isabelle's ML 
  environment.

* [Fxp.thy](Fxp.thy) provides Isabelle support for The Functional XML
  Parser (fxp).

* [Hiding_Type_Variables.thy](Hiding_Type_Variables.thy) provides
  print a setup for defining default type variables of type
  constructors. The default type variables can be hidden in output,
  e.g., `('a, 'b, 'c) foo` is shown as `(_) foo`. This shorthand
  notation can also be used in input (using a parse translation),
  which (sometimes) helps to focus on the important parts of complex
  type declarations.

* [Ml_Yacc_Lib.thy](Ml_Yacc_Lib.thy) provides Isabelle support for parser 
  generated by ml-yacc (part of sml/NJ).

* [Simple_Oracle.thy](Simple_Oracle.thy) provides an example on integrating 
  an external tool as simple oracle or counter example generator, similar
  to the built-in quickcheck.

### No Longer Maintained Hacks

* Nano_JSON.thy (support for a JSON-like data exchange for Isabelle/HOL)
  has been developed into an AFP entry "[Nano_JSON](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Nano_JSON.html)", 
  which contains documentation and examples for using JSON encoded data with 
  Isabelle/HOL and Isabelle/ML.
